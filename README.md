## Tool

1. Astro
2. GitHub Action


### Why I choose Astro ?
During that time, I decided to start my own blog. I thought about using Hexo as the blog platform because it comes with loads of ready-to-use themes. But, as I checked out all those themes, I just couldn't find one that I really liked. I even had the crazy idea of making my own theme, but then I realized I'd have to learn this thing called ejs, which seemed like a hassle just for "making my own theme on Hexo."

Right at that moment, I stumbled upon Astro. The cool thing was that Astro could also work with GitHub Pages, and the way it worked reminded me a lot of Vue, which I already knew. So, that's why I ended up going with Astro. It felt like a more comfortable fit given what I was already familiar with.
